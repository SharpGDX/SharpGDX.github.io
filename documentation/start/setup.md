If this is your first time using SharpGDX, you're at the right place. The following steps detail how you can get your first SharpGDX project up and running.

Before you can get started with SharpGDX, you need to set up an IDE (Integrated Development Environment). It is basically an editor for your code files, which makes developing applications considerably more convenient in various ways. **If you already have an IDE installed, you can skip to the next [step](/documentation/start/project-generation).**

There are several IDEs available for C# development, the most common being Visual Studio and Rider, both which have free versions for open source or non-commercial projects.

## (1.) Visual Studio

- IDE itself: [Visual Sutdio](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads) (the "Community" edition is sufficient)

## (2.) Rider

- Coming soon...

## (3.) Visual Studio Code

- Coming soon...

## (4.) No IDE

It is possible to develop sharpGDX applications entirely without an iDE, just using a simple editor like Notepad. This approach is **not** recommended, and will not be outlined here.

**Now that you have a development environment, you can create your very first SharpGDX project. SharpGDX offers a NuGet package for that, which makes getting started easy. To get started with it, take a look [here](/documentation/start/project-generation).**
